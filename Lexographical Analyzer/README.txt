This program was designed to be ran through the command line. While the program is running it will continue to take in input from the keyboard. Because of the assignment's requirments there is no prompting for input, and the program will continue to run and accept input until terminated by the user. There are three files needed to be included when compiled: lexer.h, lexer.cpp, and drvier.cpp (main file). Below I have provided sample inputs:

	"I'm a string, I'm also a string"

	float 12.34 int 234

	Ab123("hello world") # 321ab
