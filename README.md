# Jace-Archer-Projects
This is a collection of projects that I've completed. These are meant to used as an indicator of my programming ability and style. This should
by no means by considered a complete portfolio. However, I am proud of the programs I post here and am happy to show them off. 
The programs were either given out as assignments at Stephen F. Austin State University, or as tests while interviewing for different
companies.
